        Hi, there! My name is DrenizÃ«. I'm a data scientist and psychologist based in Hamburg, Germany. 
        I'm very curious about health care data and psychological side effects of coding. I also like to paint bigger pictures and take surf vacations.
        I'm just starting out in data science, so I created this space to document my progresses. </p>
